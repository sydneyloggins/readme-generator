# ReadMe Generator

## Description

This project presents users with prompts in the terminal to fill in in order to make a professional readme file. The motivation behind the project was to learn how to implement node.js in the local terminal to create an application. I built this project to better understand how to utilize node with JavaScript to create simple applications. This projects solves the problem of users needing a template for a readme and creates simple, built in prompts to make the experience simple. I learned how to combine all the skills I have learned so far to create this project.
